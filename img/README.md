# **Before** uploading a picture, please do the following #

## Colours ##
1. Images should generally have saturation and colours that are ok with our style guideline.
2. If you want to put something over an image, there **must** be a big area with a high contrast to your content.
3. We only use professional stock photo.
4. Icons must be in the corporate colours.
5. Foreign brands must be balck and white, no matter what.

## Filesize ##
1. Please make sure, any file is in .jpg or .png
2. Please crop each file in the appropriate size.
3. If in doubt, check the size of similar pictures and stick to that.
4. Crop all meta-data and give it a clear name. That is easiest exporting it from photoshop or similar tools.

## Compression ##
Before uploading, go to www.compressor.io and upload the file. Choose the lossy compression and try to squeeze the kb out of the files.
Now you are good to go with the small file.


# **After** uploading a picture, please do the following #
* The picture **must** be in the CC0-licence or purchased by us, otherwise we won't use it.
* An exception are logos, which are free to use.
* If not found on Pexel, think twice to include it.
* If it's still a good idea, go to the imprint and add the source.
